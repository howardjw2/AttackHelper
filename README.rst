AttackHelper
==============

*Great for dnd enthusiasts who want to save time in combat.*
 
This program is designed for certain characters in the game of dungeons and dragons. The types of characters for whom this program is meant for includes any characters that are barbarians of any level or paladins up to level 12. Any combination of these two classes is also viable, so long as paladin does not go beyond level 12. There is a limited selection of weapons available in this program at the moment.
 
Look how easy it is to use:
 
    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()

Unfamiliar with Dnd? No problem!
