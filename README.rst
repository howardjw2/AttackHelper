AttackHelper
==============

*Great for dnd enthusiasts who want to save time in combat.*
 
The purpose of this program is to automate an attack in dungeons and dragons. Normally, making an attack takes time and you have to roll quite a few dice, so this system aims to reduce the headache. This program is designed for certain characters in the game of dungeons and dragons. The types of characters for whom this program is meant for includes any characters that are barbarians of any level or paladins up to level 12. Any combination of these two classes is also viable, so long as paladin does not go beyond level 12. There is a limited selection of weapons available in this program at the moment. User must understand basic java to use this program as intended.

Unfamiliar with Dnd? No Problem!
--------------------------------
Terms to Know:

- Armor Class: a number assigned to every creature that shows how hard it is to hit
- Attack Roll: a number calculated by rolling a twenty sided die and adding different modifers to it
- Creature: refers to all living entities including monsters and players
- GM: this is the head of each dungeons and dragons campaign. They hold all information and designate the actions of non-player characters
- NAT TWENNY: this is a possible result of the attack roll of the program. A NAT TWENNY always hits the target and does extra damage.

The combat system of dungeons and dragons can be a daunting thing. AttackHelper is here to help simplify all of this for you, but there are still a few things you must know when fighting. As soon as combat begins in dungeons and dragons all creatures participating roll initiative and then during combat each creature takes its turn based on that initiative roll. Rolling initiative means to roll a twenty sided die and add your dexterity modifier to it. On your turn if you are nearby a creature, you can attack it - here is where you use the program. After configuring the program as you want (configuration information is available later), click on the large "Do The Thing" button on the left. The largest number at the bottom of the GUI is calculated using your stats and a simulated roll of a twenty sided die, and this number must surpass the enemy's armor class in order for the damage to go through. If the enemy's armor class is low enough, congrats! Simply tell your GM your total damage, as designated in the GUI. Otherwise, your attack does not hit.
