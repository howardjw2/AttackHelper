<p><em>Great for dnd enthusiasts who want to save time in combat or for new players who want to make combat easier.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to automate an attack in dungeons and dragons. Normally, making an attack takes time and you have to roll quite a few dice and make calculations, so this system aims to reduce the headache. This program is designed for certain characters in the game of dungeons and dragons. The types of characters for whom this program is meant for includes any characters that are barbarians of any level or paladins up to level 12. Any combination of these two classes is also viable, so long as paladin does not go beyond level 12. There is a limited selection of weapons available in this program at the moment. It is recommended that the user understands basic java and has all necessary installations to run a java program.</p>

<h2>Unfamiliar with Dnd? No Problem!<a class="headerlink" href="#unfamiliar-with-dnd-no-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Terms to Know:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Armor Class: a number assigned to every creature that shows how hard it is to hit.</p></li>
<li><p>Attack Roll: a number calculated by rolling a twenty sided die and adding different modifers to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Creature: refers to all living entities including monsters and players.</p></li>
<li><p>GM: this is the head of each dungeons and dragons campaign. They hold all information and designate the actions of non-player characters.</p></li>
<li><p>NAT TWENNY: this is a possible result of the attack roll of the program. A NAT TWENNY always hits the target and does extra damage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combat system of dungeons and dragons can be a daunting thing. AttackHelper is here to help simplify all of this for you, but there are still a few things you must know when fighting. As soon as combat begins in dungeons and dragons all creatures participating roll initiative and then during combat each creature takes its turn based on that initiative roll. Rolling initiative means to roll a twenty sided die and add your dexterity modifier to it. On your turn if you are nearby a creature, you can attack it - here is where you use the program. After configuring the program as you want (configuration information is available later), click on the large “Do The Thing” button on the left. The largest number at the bottom of the GUI is calculated using your stats and a simulated roll of a twenty sided die, and this number must surpass the enemy’s armor class in order for the damage to go through. If the enemy’s armor class is low enough, congrats! Simply tell your GM your total damage, as designated in the GUI. Otherwise, your attack does not hit.</p>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Please note that you must have a java development kit installed on your computer.</em></p>
<p>If you would like to download or just look at the code, please visit the github page <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/howardjw2/AttackHelper/">https://github.com/howardjw2/AttackHelper/</a>. On this page there is a .jar file and multiple .java files. You can download the .jar file if you would like a simple executable app with the default settings for the program, or you can download the .java files and configure them as you wish (see next section “Configurations in the Code”).</p>
<p>After the download and after making any desired changes, you can turn the .java files into a .jar file. You must have a java runtime environment if you wish to do this and you should have a basic understanding of java. To turn the program into a jar file, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html</a></p>
<p>Also, if you’re curious about the naming scheme of the java files, the name Bol comes from the character that this program was originally based on.</p>

<h2>Configurations in the Code<a class="headerlink" href="#configurations-in-the-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have installed all .java files, there is not much to change. Simply look at lines 27-29 of the file BolAttacks.java</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Line 27: Change the value of PROFICIENCY_BONUS to the correct proficiency bonus (see <a class="reference external" href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_3">https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Line 28: Change the value of STRENGTH_BONUS to your correct strength modifier (see <a class="reference external" href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_1">https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Line 29: Change the value of DEXTERITY_BONUS to your correct dexterity modifier (see <a class="reference external" href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_1">https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_1</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, you can now run the program!</p>

<p>Further Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The +3 and the +2 for the goat staff and demon hammer also denote a higher chance of hitting the target (+3 and +2 to attack rolls).</p></li>
<li><p>The numbers for range (n/m) denote short range and long range. Any target within short range can be attacked from that distance, but further targets that are not beyond long range are more difficult to hit and you must select “Disadvantage” in the advantage dropbox.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, distances in dungeons and dragons are measured by feet.</p></li>
<li><p>Weapons here, unless otherwise specified, can only hit nearby enemies within 5 feet of your character.</p></li>

<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Why does your documentation not explain everything about combat in dungeons and dragons?</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p>The combat in dungeons and dragons can get very complicated, and although I went over the basics of it here, it is recommended you ask for help from a fellow player or GM, or read the official Player’s Handbook, made by Wizards of the Coast. Official websites also contain the necessary information if you need it (roll20.net and dndbeyond.com).</p></li>
